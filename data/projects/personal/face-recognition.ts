    "A Face Recognition project in Python that can be employed for diverse applications.",
  content: ` - Built a face recognition project to recognize faces in live feed.\n - Used Python, Jupyter Notebook & face_recognition library for the same.\n - In the first part of the project, we create face encodings by using the available images. These encodings are then saved in .dat files. \n - In the second part of the project, we execute the facial recognition process & a camera live feed window will appear. \n - The user can press 'r' on their keyboard to initiate the recognition process. The result of the recognition process will then be displayed. If the recognized user is a registered user, the program can be modified to take further action based on the user's identity.
