    "A full stack application to detect face in an image on the cloud. This was a project I built while I was learning full stack development as a part of an Udemy Course.",
  content: ` - Built a full stack JavaScript application to detect face in an image on the cloud with user registration.\n - Used React.js, HTML5, CSS3, React Bootstrap and particles.js on the front-end. Created a Restful API on the back-end using Node.js and Express.js to handle requests from the front-end and respond accordingly after interacting with a PostgreSQL database using knex.\n - Deployed the application 100% on cloud using Heroku, Git and Github.
